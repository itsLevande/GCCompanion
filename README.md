# GCCompanion
A primitive tool for creating Groove Coaster arcade stages.

# About
This is still very much a work in progress. While this program is mostly feature complete, a lot of things may feel unituitive. This is by design as I intended GCCompanion to just be a proof-of-concept to show that custom stage creation is very much possible. I'll try my best to patch out any unforeseen issues as they appear while also taking user feedback into account when designing the next iterations of this tool.

# Required Software
1. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/), for designing the courseline. Although any program that can export to .obj files should suffice.
2. [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel), for filling out courseline.csv files, as well as updating Arcade's stage param.
3. Any tool to help with correctly syncing up audio files, such as [ArrowVortex](https://arrowvortex.ddrnl.com/).
4. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), not strictly required, but a tool for trimming .wav files is quite useful.
